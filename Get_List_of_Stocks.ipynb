    "I received a few questions from multiple followers regarding a working list of all traded stocks. This is generally followed by an explanation that they want to apply machine-learning or artificial intelligence to predict stock prices. My initial response is always, that sounds like fun, let's start with a data-set that is a bit smaller first and ideally one that you are familiar with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing **ALL** traded stocks would become unwieldy rather quickly. Most stock data services have limits even on their paid plans. Using [funnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/) as an example, their most expensive plan at \\\\$500 a month only allows for 300 API calls a minute. That is 216,000 API calls a day to retrieve data and a quick look at [gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock_list.php?p=0&n=30) indicates around 120,000 stocks, and I'm not certain that is all of them. At 300 API call an hour it would take half a day to get the latest information and most likely you would want to run multiple API calls on at least some of those symbols. The only way you are going to get faster data than that is to spend many thousands of dollars and if you have that kind of money you wouldn't be asking me how to get all the ticker symbols. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, let's make something a bit more reasonable. Everyone is familiar with the New York Stock Exchange ([NYSE](https://www.nyse.com/index)), and whether they know it by its actual name or not, the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System ([Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/)). So let's start with these, and the very first thing you are going to need is a list of all their associated tickers symbols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we could scrape this data and indeed if we wanted to constrain our search to the S&P 500 only we could get its list of symbols in three lines of python"
